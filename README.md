# Ryan's Alarm
An Android app to work as an alarm with some niceties:
- Gentle awake via slowly increasing volume
- Set alarm time as time
- Set alarm time as time from now

This is also going to be used to learn Kotlin and possible other new(er) Android Studio technologies such as jetpack compose.
